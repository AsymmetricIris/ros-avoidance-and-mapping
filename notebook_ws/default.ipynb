    "Known bug:\n",
    "If a lower approach velocity is used, the rosbot will start teleporting forwards and falling over when it tries to turn around corners\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have a lot of guesses why.\n",
    "But, it could be the result of errors in speed adjustment or communicating on the ros ignite end. I have not had the chance to test the code on my local ros install, yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning issue:\n",
    "Also, behaviour is tuned for this velocity or greater. If lower velocities are used, corner behaviour becomes less reliable even if known bug (not the algorithm) doesn't occur"
